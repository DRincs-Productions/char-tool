You can use "03 Tub Zero" to create a scene centered group for the Bathtub.

Create your tub (DO NOT MOVE THE TUB!!!) and then decorate it as you like.

Then use the "03 Tub Zero" to create a Tub Zero group in the scene tab.

Now drag your Bathtub into the newly created Tub Zero group.

Now your tub has a scene zero identical to your figures, and all can share the same rotation!
